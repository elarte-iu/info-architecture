<p>Starting last year, I began making a concerted effort to become a better cook. Spurred on by a family member's generous gift of a subscription to a cooking magazine, I've been branching out and trying at least a couple new dishes a month, prioritizing variety in cuisine and in ingredients. It's satisfying to become comfortable using a variety of ingredients, including some with which I did not grow up, and gaining the experience needed to start modifying recipes to my own preference, and those of others.</p>
